# Timtrack
**! This project has just started and it's just barely usable !**

This project is a time tracking utility heavily inspired by
[timetrap](https://github.com/samg/timetrap), but written in Rust,
to improve performance.

Timetrack does not aim to be a full timetrap clone, but will
include the most used commands and both a user-friendly output
and a JSON output that can be piped into other commands or
applications.

## Things to do 
- [ ] Add the "month" command as an alias for display
- [ ] Check for edge cases (e.g. all sheets removed)
- [ ] Improve code quality
- [ ] Add tests
